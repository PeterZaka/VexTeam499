# VexTeam499
Team 499S's code for 2020-2021 Vex competition.

- **main branch** - updated when code worked without any issues
- **dev branch** - implement new features/pull from update branch/push to main branch
- **update branch** - used to upload to github without using terminal. Click add file > upload files and highlight include/src folder, .v5code and then commit changes

This project was created somewhere around September 2020 then uploaded around January 2021 when I learned how to use Github. This project was made while I was starting to learn more about C++ so there is bad practices such using raw pointers instead of smart pointers, not reading VEXcode Pro V5, etc.

There is comments on the top of most of the header files to include some feedback.
